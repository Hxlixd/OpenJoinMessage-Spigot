# OpenJoinMessage-Spigot
An open source plugin that lets you customize server messages whenever a player joins or leaves

!! SETUP !!

- Step 1: you need to download MariaDB Server from https://downloads.mariadb.org/ and make sure you have any SQL DBMS like HeidiSQL that comes installed along with MariaDB.

- Step 2: once you have opened it you will then create a new session using "MariaDB or MySQL (TCP/IP)" as network type and "libmariadb.dll" as library.

- Step 3: run the server and a script will automatically create the "ojmdb_config.json" file inside the plugin folder, then open it, put the authentication info of your database server and then restart the server
  (i won't recommend you to just use the reload command).
